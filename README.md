# amethyst
A 2.5d open world rogue-light within a persistent world, with metroidvania elements. Think the bastard child of terraria, below and castle vania with it slight hint of darksouls and skyrim.

## Core Features

### Perma-death: 
```
Once a character is dead he or she will stay dead, for the most part. There are ways to bring back dead characters if one truly wishes.

```
### Randomly-generated characters: 
```
Each time a hero falls, another shall take thy place. Heroes come equipped with different abilities, starting equipment and character traits. On one instance, you could play as a demi-god who has lightning powers, on the other hand, you could play as a scrub with no useful traits.

```
### Exploration: 
```
The world is steaming with life, adventures and secrets if one is willing to look hard enough.
```

### Customization: 
```
All traits of a character can be customised later on, and it's up to the player to discover this.
NPCS: Unique NPCs with a purpose
